## Problem

My GIS department has been contacted by our State representatives to analyze the results of an industrial extension jobs survey for the upcoming elections.  The representatives are interested in showing how their policies have created jobs, and to compare their successes to neighboring districts.  I will be using extensive use of both tabular and spatial joins to combine spatial data with the survey results.

## Analysis Procedures

### Strategies

This exercise requires the use of both tabular and spatial joins in ArcGIS.  The industrial extension jobs survey is presented in the form of an excel table.  I was able to retrieve the other two datasets through the NC State GIS library, and ArcGIS online.  Once I prepared all of the layers for analysis by selecting only the data that falls within North Carolina I was able to begin the analysis.  First I'll combine data from different companies by zip code, and connect this data to the point shapefile of zip code centroids.  I'll then use a spatial join to connect data from zip codes to individual House and Senate districts.

### Methods

To complete this exercise, first I converted the tabular data from having a single record per company in our area interest to a single row for each zip code while summing the total number of jobs created using the summarize tool in the attribute table.  At this point I quickly checked my work by selecting all of the records from the original dataset with the single summarized dataset to ensure they had the same number of jobs created.  I then joined the table to the shapefile of zip codes in North Carolina that were represented as points with a tabular join.  Finally I spatially joined the zip code points containing the total number of jobs created to individual House and Senate districts, which I used to display the results.

## Discussion

### Difficulties

The main difficulty I ran into while trying to complete this exercise was the difference between the Spatial Join Geoprocessing tool and the Spatial Join tool available when right-clicking a layer in the ArcMap Table of Contents.  The Geoprocessing tool does not appear to allow the user to dictate which field should be aggregated when there is a one-to-many relationship between the target and join features.  I kept checking my answer by comparing the inputs with the final product and found that the total jobs created was not being summed.  I then used the spatial join option by using the right-click method in the TOC and was able to choose the merge operation (sum), and this operation was applied to all fields.

The other difficulty I had when trying to map the results was that there were several null values in my completed House Districts dataset.  When I tried to map the number of jobs created any district with a value of null was omitted.  To fix this issue I opened an editing session and the field calculator.  I used the following simple Python function to replace null values with a value of zero:  

{% highlight python %}
def updateValues(value):
    if value is None:
        return 0
    else:
        return value

updateValues(!EMPLOY_SUM!)
{% endhighlight %}

### Evaluation

I was able to check my work throughout the process to ensure it's accuracy.  For example after each join/sum step I would compare a subset of the original dataset with the corresponding subset of the resulting dataset to ensure the numbers matched.  If they did not I re-considered how I approached the problem as mentioned above where I changed how I completed the spatial join.  As such I am very confident in the results of my analysis.

## Application & Reflection

The concepts learned in this exercise can be easily applied to a number of different problems in GIS.  For example, we can join tabular data describing a species (i.e. taxonomic, and conservation status information) with actual survey points.  This way if the scientific name or conservation status should change, we only need to change the data in one place rather than in every single survey record.  This also reduces the total amount of information needed to collect during a survey and reduces the total size of our database.  Eventually we could use survey data of endangered species to answer a question similar to this exercise where a political representative wants to know how our data relates to their specific district.  This can be accomplished with a spatial join just like we did in this exercise joining zip code data with Senate and House districts.
